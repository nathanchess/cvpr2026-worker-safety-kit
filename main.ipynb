        "## 1. Objective\n",
        "This project aims to build a demo application and tutorial that serves as the primary **\"Enablement Asset\"** for the **CVPR 2026 Worker Safety Challenge**. It serves as a semantic dataset curator and visualizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The asset demonstrates an end-to-end example workflow between **TwelveLabs** and **FiftyOne**, providing a tool for participants to build a high-quality, small-data training set from raw footage without manual framing.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Strategic Goal**: Demonstrate that \"Small Data\" does not mean \"Manual Data.\" We aim to show how modern semantic search can replace hours of manual video scrubbing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Challenge Context\n",
        "*   **Event**: 3rd CV4Smalls Workshop @ CVPR 2026.\n",
        "*   **Track**: Challenge Track (Worker Safety).\n",
        "\n",
        "### The \"Enablement\" Gap\n",
        "Participants will see an end-to-end workflow utilizing:\n",
        "1.  **Marengo 3.0 Vector Embedding Generation**: For multimodal understanding.\n",
        "2.  **Pegasus Cluster Metadata & Identification**: For zero-shot auto-labeling.\n",
        "3.  **Voxel51 UI Data Curation and Visualizer**: For interactive exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using this general semantic data curator, participants will gain hands-on exposure to the underlying API and SDK for both platforms, avoiding the high latency of 40+ hours of manual video scrubbing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Setup and Dependencies\n",
        "The following cell installs the necessary Python packages: `fiftyone`, `twelvelabs`, `python-dotenv`, and `torch`."
